I want to design my root website mastorscdn (Logo: https://surajit-singha-sisir.github.io/mastorsCDN/Resources/svg/logo/mastorsCDN-darkbg.svg). This is a frontend css and sass mixin utility library. Please read the documentation  for mastors-fluider and gridder here:
https://kehem-it.github.io/Mastors-Fluider/
https://kehem-it.github.io/Mastors-Gridder/
I installed those mixins scss utility. You needs to use those to design the mastorscdn root webpage html. If you needs you can create scss file inside styles.
Write ts file for scripts.
Dark is the primary bg. Use fontawesome, prism for code view, if needs slider you can use carousal slider js cdn's or npm libraries.
Here are the logo of two libraries:
